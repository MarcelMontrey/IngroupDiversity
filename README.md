# Abstract
Studies have found that when innovation involves recombining cultural traits, partially-connected networks produce higher levels of cultural complexity than fully-connected networks because fully-connected networks suffer from cultural homogenization. However, population connectedness is only one of many factors that could promote cultural diversity and thus cultural accumulation. Here, we examine whether people's observed preference for copying members of their own social group could also fill this role. Our model reveals that ingroup-biased transmission results in greater cultural diversity and complexity than unbiased transmission---even in fully-connected populations. We also find that this bias interacts with population structure to enable higher levels of cultural accumulation. Finally, by incorporating population turnover into our model, we shed light on the competing interests of promoting cultural diversity versus limiting cultural loss.
